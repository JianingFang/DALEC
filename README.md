# README

This repository contains the code of a ClimaLSM-compatible implementation of the DALEC model. An example of model run can be found in the notebook directory. Please contact Jianing Fang (jf3423@columbia.edu) if you have any questions. This implementation is based on the model 811 of [the C implementation CARDAMOM_v2.2](https://github.com/CARDAMOM-framework/CARDAMOM_v2.2).
